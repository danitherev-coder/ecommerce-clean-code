# Backend Project

## DescripciÃ³n
This backend project was conceived with the main objective of learning and applying key concepts of clean architecture, with an emphasis on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) implementation. In this development process, we explored and used various technologies to create a robust and modular environment.

## Technologies Used

In this project, we have applied Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, together with the following technologies:

- **Cloudinary:** Cloud storage service for image management.

- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to standard JavaScript.

- **Express:** Web application framework for Node.js.

- **Node.js:** Execution environment for server-side JavaScript.

- **MercadoPago API:** MercadoPago API for payment management.

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used to store data.

These technologies are integrated in a Clean Architecture that follows the principles of separation of concerns and the application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to structure our code in a modular and domain-centric way.
